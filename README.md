## 🚀 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to classify **grain yield** into three categories based on environmental and agronomic factors:  

- **High Yield** → `A`  
- **Medium Yield** → `B`  
- **Low Yield** → `C`  

We tested **multiple machine learning approaches** to determine the most effective **feature selection & classification strategy** for this problem.
